## The Streaming Hype

“Real-time” is one of those phrases that shows up almost every time some one is talking about data platforms. It sounds impressive and essential. But the reality? Most teams do not actually need true real-time streaming.

## When Streaming Is Justified

There are use cases where streaming is genuinely valuable:

* **Fraud detection**: catching suspicious transactions as they happen.
    
* **IoT / telemetry**: where devices continuously emit signals.
    
* **Real-time personalization**: serving recommendations while the user is still on the page.
    

## When Streaming Is Overkill

* Daily or hourly reporting pipelines built on Kafka “because it is real-time.”
    
* Teams burning engineering hours debugging offsets, lag, and exactly-once semantics for data that could have been processed every 15 minutes in a batch job.
    
* Costs ballooning from always-on clusters and high-throughput message brokers — for data that did not need millisecond delivery.
    

## The Batch Alternative

For the majority of analytics and ML workflows, **batch or micro-batch** pipelines are simpler, cheaper, and more reliable:

* **ETL jobs**: running hourly or daily is enough for most cases.
    
* **Model training**: retraining weekly or daily does not benefit from real-time data.
    
* **Dashboards** – refreshing every 15 minutes feels real-time to most stakeholders.
    

Modern platforms (like Databricks with Delta Live Tables, Azure Synapse pipelines, Airflow, etc.) make batch pipelines robust and scalable without the operational overhead of streaming.

## The Hidden Costs of Streaming

Building streaming systems is not free and easy:

* **Operational overhead**: monitoring lag, offsets, consumer groups.
    
* **Complexity**: exactly-once delivery, late-arriving events, schema evolution.
    
* **Cost**: brokers, always-on compute, storage of raw + processed streams.
    

Unless there’s a clear business case for &lt;1 minute latency, the overhead usually outweighs the benefit.

## Final Thoughts

Streaming is really powerful when done right and used in correct context. But for most data teams, the value comes from reliable, maintainable pipelines that deliver data when the business actually needs it.
