Data pipelines are the backbone of modern platforms, but they come at a cost. Costs creep in through compute, storage, and networking — and unless they are being monitored, they show up not in design docs, but in the cloud bill.

For small and busy teams, this can hit hard. In our case, it once meant an **unexpected A$8,000 spike in a single month**, all from a default storage configuration we hadn’t even realised was enabled.

In this post, let’s look at some of the most common hidden costs in data pipelines, along with practical steps we’ve taken to control them.

## 1\. Compute Overprovisioning vs Smart Reservations

**The hidden cost:** Always-on clusters, oversized VMs, or idle containers running 24/7 even though data only arrives once or twice an hour.

**What I have seen:** ML training VMs, inference endpoints, and containerized services left running on-demand around the clock. The workloads were steady and predictable but the on-demand pricing was quietly draining the budget.

**Control:**

* For unpredictable workloads: use **autoscaling** (Databricks jobs, Kubernetes, Container Apps).
    
* For predictable workloads: switch to **Reserved Instances** or **Savings Plans**.
    

We moved our live inference endpoints, model training VMs, Container Apps, Container Instances, and eligible databases onto **reservations and savings plans**.

This immediately lowered our baseline compute costs without changing a single line of pipeline code.

## 2\. Networking & Storage Replication: The GRS Surprise

One of the biggest hidden costs in cloud data platforms is data replication and cross-region movement.

Learned this the hard way: the Azure Blob Storage attached to our Databricks workspace was set to **Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)** by default. That meant every piece of data written was being replicated across regions, even though geo-redundancy was not needed.

The result? An **extra A$8,000** in a single billing cycle, made up of unnecessary storage replication and cross-region egress charges.

**Control:**

* Be explicit with storage redundancy:
    
    * **LRS (Locally Redundant)** for most workloads.
        
    * **ZRS (Zone Redundant)** if you need availability across zones.
        
    * Reserve **GRS** for critical data that *truly* needs cross-region failover.
        

## 3\. Pipeline Failures & Retries

**The hidden cost:** Pipelines failing silently and retrying endlessly. Each retry consumes compute and storage, multiplying costs.

Daily ETL jobs failing due to schema drift, retrying 10+ times before alerting anyone wasting hours of compute.

**Control:**

* Add **schema validation and contracts** at ingestion.
    
* Configure **sensible retry policies** with proper alerts.
    
* Monitor pipeline SLAs, if a job fails send an alerts - for us, it is Microsoft Teams channel where notifications are being sent
    

## 4\. Orphaned Resources

**The hidden cost:** Forgotten dev clusters, staging environments, or test containers left running long after they are needed.

**Control:**

* Automate teardown of non-prod resources after inactivity.
    
* Apply **tags and budgets** to all environments.
    
* Until automated clean-up scheduled jobs are not setup, manually review prediocally

## Bringing in FinOps Practices

Managing costs is not just about cutting spend — it is about **visibility and accountability**.

* Use **tags** to attribute costs by project, team, and environment - we are still not at the top of this game.
    
* Set up **budget alerts** in Azure Cost Management (or AWS Budgets, GCP Billing) - we have one setup for each development and production enviroment.
    
* Review spend regularly with the team, cost awareness is part of engineering.

## Final Thoughts

The hidden costs of data pipelines are real: oversized compute, cross-region replication, retries, and orphaned resources. I have seen them all.

The fix is not to cut corners, it is to spend smarter:

* Reserve what is predictable.
    
* Autoscale burstable workload.
    
* Audit defaults before they burn you.
